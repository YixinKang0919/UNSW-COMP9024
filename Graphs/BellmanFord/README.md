# BellmanFord's algorithm


### Introducton

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a single-source shortest-path algorithm for graphs that may have negative weight edges. 

It can also detect negative weight cycles in the graph, which is a key feature that distinguishes it from other shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.

#### Motivation
- Check all edges (n-1) times to calculate the shortest distances, where n is the number of nodes
- Check all edges one more time to detect negative cycles

Suppose edges are checked in ascending order of their source nodes.

### make view

**Ensure that you have executed 'make' and './main' before 'make view'.**


```sh
BellmanFord$ make view
find ./images -name "*.png" | sort | xargs feh -g 720x540 &
```

**Click on the window of 'feh' or use your mouse scroll wheel to view images**.

Here, **feh** is an image viewer available in [CSE VLAB](https://vlabgateway.cse.unsw.edu.au/).
